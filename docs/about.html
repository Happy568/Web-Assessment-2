  <h1>Resident Evil Village Overview</h1>
  <p>Ethan and his wife Mia have relocated to a remote village in Eastern Europe under the protection of BSAA Captain Chris Redfield,
  aiming to live peacefully with their newborn daughter, Rosemary. However, their tranquility is shattered when Chris and his team raid their home, 
  assassinate Mia, and abduct Ethan and Rosemary.</p>
  
  <p>Ethan awakens near a crashed transport truck and discovers that Rosemary is missing. As he searches for her, he encounters a mysterious village plagued by werewolf-like creatures known as Lycans. 
  The village is under the control of Mother Miranda and her four lords: Alcina Dimitrescu, Donna Beneviento, Salvatore Moreau, and Karl Heisenberg.</p>
  
  <p>Ethan learns that Rosemary has been fragmented into four flasks, each held by one of the lords, as part of a ritual by Mother Miranda to resurrect her deceased daughter, Eva.
  Determined to save his daughter, Ethan confronts each lord, retrieves the flasks, and ultimately faces Mother Miranda. </p>
